## About KCLES

King’s College London has one of the oldest engineering programmes in the UK.  
The Department of Civil Engineering and Mining was established in **1838**, followed by the founding of the **King’s College London Engineering Society (KCLES)** in **1847**.  

In its early years, the society held regular readings of scientific and engineering papers — averaging 12–20 each year — on topics such as early photography, modern manufacturing methods, bridges, tunnels, railways, and other civil engineering projects.

In **1854**, the society changed its name to the *King’s College Scientific Society*, but was briefly dissolved in **1855**. It was re-established just two years later, in **1857**, by Professor **Thomas Minchin Goodeve**. From around **1870**, the society grew in both popularity and importance, counting among its members future presidents of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, **Llewellyn Atkinson** and **Charles Henry Wordingham**.

KCLES went on to establish a rich tradition of events and initiatives:
- Regular **instructional visits** to engineering sites began in **1886**
- Occasional **exhibitions** started in **1894**
- The first **annual dinner** was held in **1895**
- **Lunch-time debates** began around **1906**
- The **Old Students Section** was formed in **1919**
- The first issue of *The King’s Engineer* magazine was published in **1921–1922**

During the Second World War, the society relocated with King’s College to Bristol (**1939–1943**), and later celebrated its **centenary in 1947**. KCLES remains active today, continuing its legacy of innovation, collaboration, and engineering excellence.
