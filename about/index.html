<h1>About KCLES</h1>
<h2>About KCLES</h2>
<p>King’s College London has one of the oldest engineering programmes in the UK.<br>
The Department of Civil Engineering and Mining was established in <strong>1838</strong>, followed by the founding of the <strong>King’s College London Engineering Society (KCLES)</strong> in <strong>1847</strong>.</p>
<p>In its early years, the society held regular readings of scientific and engineering papers — averaging 12–20 each year — on topics such as early photography, modern manufacturing methods, bridges, tunnels, railways, and other civil engineering projects.</p>
<p>In <strong>1854</strong>, the society changed its name to the <em>King’s College Scientific Society</em>, but was briefly dissolved in <strong>1855</strong>. It was re-established just two years later, in <strong>1857</strong>, by Professor <strong>Thomas Minchin Goodeve</strong>. From around <strong>1870</strong>, the society grew in both popularity and importance, counting among its members future presidents of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, <strong>Llewellyn Atkinson</strong> and <strong>Charles Henry Wordingham</strong>.</p>
<p>KCLES went on to establish a rich tradition of events and initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular <strong>instructional visits</strong> to engineering sites began in <strong>1886</strong></li>
<li>Occasional <strong>exhibitions</strong> started in <strong>1894</strong></li>
<li>The first <strong>annual dinner</strong> was held in <strong>1895</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lunch-time debates</strong> began around <strong>1906</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Old Students Section</strong> was formed in <strong>1919</strong></li>
<li>The first issue of <em>The King’s Engineer</em> magazine was published in <strong>1921–1922</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>During the Second World War, the society relocated with King’s College to Bristol (<strong>1939–1943</strong>), and later celebrated its <strong>centenary in 1947</strong>. KCLES remains active today, continuing its legacy of innovation, collaboration, and engineering excellence.</p>
