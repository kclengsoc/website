<h1>About KCLES</h1>
<p>King’s College London has one of the oldest engineering programmes in the UK.<br>
The Department of Civil Engineering and Mining was established in 1838, followed by the founding of the King’s College London Engineering Society (KCLES) in 1847.</p>
<p>In its early years, the society held regular readings of scientific and engineering papers — averaging 12–20 each year — on topics such as early photography, modern manufacturing methods, bridges, tunnels, railways, and other civil engineering projects.</p>
<p>In 1854, the society changed its name to the King’s College Scientific Society, but was briefly dissolved in 1855. It was re-established just two years later, in 1857, by Professor Thomas Minchin Goodeve. From around 1870, the society grew in both popularity and importance, counting among its members future presidents of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, Llewellyn Atkinson and Charles Henry Wordingham.</p>
<p>KCLES went on to establish a rich tradition of events and initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular instructional visits to engineering sites began in 1886</li>
<li>Occasional exhibitions started in 1894</li>
<li>The first annual dinner was held in 1895</li>
<li>Lunch-time debates began around 1906</li>
</ul>
<p>KCLES remains active today, continuing its legacy of innovation, collaboration, and engineering excellence.</p>
